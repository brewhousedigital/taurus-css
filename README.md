# Taurus CSS

[![Built with Grunt](https://cdn.gruntjs.com/builtwith.svg)](https://gruntjs.com/)

This is a lightweight css framework forked from Bootstrap. Most of the preset backgrounds and font colors have been removed. This will make it easier to implement themes in your site. Almost all the redundant styling classes such as "card" or "alert" have been removed too. You can easily recreate these using ```class="d-flex border p-3"```.

Bootstrap 4.5 is at **157kb** ❌

Taurus CSS is at **55kb** ✅ 

Save some space and load time, and write your HTML to render only what is needed.
