# Taurus CSS

[![Built with Grunt](https://cdn.gruntjs.com/builtwith.svg)](https://gruntjs.com/)

This is a lightweight css framework forked from Bootstrap. Most of the preset backgrounds and font colors have been removed. This will make it easier to implement themes in your site. Almost all the redundant styling classes such as "card" or "alert" have been removed too. You can easily recreate these using ```class="d-flex border p-3"```.

Bootstrap 4.5 is at **157kb** ❌

Taurus CSS is at **55kb** ✅ 

Save some space and load time, and write your HTML to render only what is needed.

## Items removed:
- [x] Media Queries SM, MD, LG
- [x] Redundant decorators like card and navbar
- [x] All buttons and colors except for primary


## For even smaller size:

You can mix and match your own partials for a custom build.

## What if I want to use all of Bootstrap 4?

No styles have been altered in this fork, just a lot of things removed. You will be able to drop in the full Bootstrap 4 library and replace Taurus CSS without any problems.
